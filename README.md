# QtShaderEditor

This project relies on [tinyobjloader](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader).
Sample meshes are provided [here](http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/data/meshes.xml). Be aware that Qt's TGA support is spotty. Some images and MTL files may need to be modified.

Unzip into a directory named tinyobjloader located in the top level of the project (with all the source files). tinyobjloader provides a link to some pre-made OBJ packages. These can be used for testing here as well. Be aware that some of the packages were not made with case-sensitivity in mind and may require file renaming to work on case-sensitive platforms.
