# QtShaderEditor
Shader editor based on the Qt Framework

This project relies on tinyobjloader: https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader
Unzip into a directory named tinyobjloader located in the top level of the project (with all the source files). tinyobjloader provides a link to some pre-made OBJ packages. These can be used for testing here as well. Be aware that some of the packages were not made with case-sensitivity in mind and may require file renaming to work on case-sensitive platforms.
